                <li>Make mistakes</li>
                    <p>Don't be afraid to fail. No one likes to fail but we all do it those who have success are the ones who learn from their mistakes and continue progressing forward.</p>
                <li>Enjoy what you do</li>
                    <p>Many people look for money as a way to pick a job but that's how you get in a dead end job where you look forward to the weekend and then retirement. That's wasting your life. So enjoy what you do.</p>
                <li>Dont burn yourself out</li>
                    <p>Take breaks we all want to progress in our career or hobbies so much so that we get burnt out and we no longer enjoy what we use to love doing.</p>
                <li>Make time for others</li>
                    <p>Life is short so make sure you spend your time with people you enjoy being around and that make you a better person for doing so.</p>
                <li>Look at the world around you</li>
                    <p>Stop and smell the roses is something you always hear but never do. When as a designer you should be inspired by the world around you.</p>
                <li>Always be creating</li>
                    <p>We can always improve our art and our style but it's hard to do when you don't practice your art. By reading other artist work ethics we incorporate some into our work ethics.</p>
